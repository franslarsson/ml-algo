# ml_algo

## Motivation
The purpose with this project is to implement various machine learning algorithms for my own learning. Thus, the 
implementations are not in any way efficient and should not be used for real modelling. However, I find implementing 
algorithms from scratch a great way of learning how they work and to make sure that I have understood the concepts. 
Hopefully these implementations can be of some use for others as well. I'll therefore keep the project public.
