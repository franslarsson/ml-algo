## Motivation
The purpose with this project is to implement various machine learning algorithms for learning. Thus, the implemantions are not in any way effecient and should not be used for real modelling. However, I find implementing algorithms from scratch a great way of learning how they work and hopefully these implementations will be of some use for others as well.
